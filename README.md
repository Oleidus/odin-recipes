Working on this coding project has been a valuable learning experience. I have improved my understanding of Markdown formatting, file organization, and the basics of version control with Git. Throughout the process, I practiced breaking down tasks into manageable steps and writing clear, readable code. I also learned the importance of testing and reviewing my work to ensure accuracy. This project has increased my confidence in building and documenting simple applications, and I look forward to applying these skills to more complex projects in the future.
